# Finance Dashboard built using RShiny

The CSV included contains the data we are using for the project.

The global.R file is where the core logic of the data processing is held.

app.R calls on global.R for data and provides UI elements and other visualization specific code.

The focus of this project was to come up with a way to visualize the correlation of various global indices, observe periods of drawdown, attempt to model what a custom portfolio of these indices might have historically returned as well as find a way to come up with a portfolio matching our target volatility

This project was completed in 2021 with my friend Natthanon as part of our internship and was built off pre-existing projects by multiple users such as pmaji (https://github.com/pmaji/financial-asset-comparison-tool). The codebase is vaguely maintained for educational purposes but is not being actively updated
